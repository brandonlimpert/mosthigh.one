This is a Christian website for exploring Scripture as a community.

Our goal is to create a platform where Scripture minded people can harness simple tools to enrich their interactions together. This allows them to keep track of their discoveries and present them to others who are interested in the same topic. It will also allow the community to interact back recommending other alternatives conclusions on fine points of discussion. As a community we can sharpen each other with God's word.

What we are looking to build:

* Main Platform - much like Github, we want to allow users to create their own repositories. In a repository, users can upload their writings in a streamlined chapter/section type manner. Say a person would like to do a deep dive into a subject, like the atonement, they would be able to organize their findings into a repository in a section by section layout that will allow others to contribute and challenge them.

* Layout - Sections should be able to have subsections. Think about a book; it has chapters which contain sections. An author who already has a published book should be able to upload his book into a repository. He should be able compartmentalize sections of his book into smaller chunks where users can focus more pointedly on a specific topic. A Repo should have a Chapters, and Chapters should have sub chapters.

* Scripture Import - Users should be able to import scripture from differing bible translations with the click of a few buttons.

* Citation Tool - Users should be able to create footnotes to link externally cited sources.

* Community Comments - Other users should be able to comment in their sub chapters only.

* Community Approval - The community should be able to like or dislike comments.

* Commits - Other users should be able to make suggestions by modifying the repo owner's subchapter manuscript in a way that the owner can accept the changes with the click of a button and have them fully integrate into the live chapter.
